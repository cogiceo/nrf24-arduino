/// \mainpage NRF24 library for Arduino
///
/// This is the Arduino NRF24 library.
/// It provides an object-oriented interface for sending and receiving data messages with Nordic nRF24L01
/// based radio modules, such as the sparkfun WRL-00691 http://www.sparkfun.com/products/691
///
/// The nRF24L01 (http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/Nordic/nRF24L01P_Product_Specification_1_0.pdf)
/// is a low-cost 2.4GHz ISM transceiver module. It supports a number of channel frequencies in the 2.4GHz band
/// and a range of data rates.
///
/// This library provides functions for sending and receiving messages of up to 32 octets on any 
/// frequency supported by the nRF24L01, at a selected data rate.
///
/// Up to 2 nRF24L01 modules can be connected to an Arduino, permitting the construction of translators
/// and frequency changers, etc.
///
/// This library provides classes for 
/// - NRF24: addressed, reliable, retransmitted, acknowledged messages (using nrf24 Enhanced Shockburst)
///
/// Example Arduino programs are included to show the main modes of use.
///
/// The version of the package that this documentation refers to can be downloaded 
/// from http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/NRF24/NRF24-1.11.zip
/// You can find the latest version at http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/NRF24
///
/// You can also find online help and disussion at http://groups.google.com/group/NRF24-arduino
/// Please use that group for all questions and discussions on this topic. 
/// Do not contact the author directly, unless it is to discuss commercial licensing.
///
/// Tested on Arduino Diecimila, Duemilanove and Mega with arduino 1.0
/// on OpenSuSE 12.1 with avr-libc-1.7.1-1.1, cross-avr-binutils-2.19.1-33.1
/// and cross-avr-gcc-4.3.3_20100125-28.1, and with arduino-0021 on the same platforms
///
/// \par Packet Format
///
/// All messages sent and received by this NRF24 library must conform to this packet format, as specified by 
/// the nRF24L01 product specificaiton:
///
/// - 1 octets PREAMBLE
/// - 4 octets ADDRESS
/// - 9 bits packet control field
/// - 0 to 32 octets PAYLOAD
/// - 2 octets CRC 
///
/// \par Connecting nRF24L01 to Arduino
///
/// The physical connection between the nRF24L01 and the Arduino require 3.3V, the 3 x SPI pins (SCK, SDI, SDO), 
/// a Chip Enable pin and a Slave Select pin.
/// If you are using the Sparkfun WRL-00691 module, it has a voltage regulator on board and 
/// can be run with 5V VCC
/// The examples below assume the Sparkfun WRL-00691 module
///
/// Connect the nRF24L01 to most Arduino's like this (Caution, Arduino Mega has different pins for SPI, 
/// see below), 
/// \code
///                 Arduino      Sparkfun WRL-00691
///                 3V3 or 5V----VCC   (3.3V to 7V in)
///             pin D8-----------CE    (chip enable in)
///          SS pin D10----------CSN   (chip select in)
///         SCK pin D13----------SCK   (SPI clock in)
///        MOSI pin D11----------SDI   (SPI Data in)
///        MISO pin D12----------SDO   (SPI data out)
///                              IRQ   (Interrupt output, not connected)
///                 GND----------GND   (ground in)
/// \endcode
///
/// For an Arduino Leonardo (the SPI pins do not come out on the Digital pins as for normal Arduino, but only
/// appear on the ICSP header)
/// \code
///                Leonardo      Sparkfun WRL-00691
///                 3V3 or 5V----VCC   (3.3V to 7V in)
///             pin D8-----------CE    (chip enable in)
///          SS pin D10----------CSN   (chip select in)
///      SCK ICSP pin 3----------SCK   (SPI clock in)
///     MOSI ICSP pin 4----------SDI   (SPI Data in)
///     MISO ICSP pin 1----------SDO   (SPI data out)
///                              IRQ   (Interrupt output, not connected)
///                 GND----------GND   (ground in)
/// \endcode
/// and initialise the NRF24 object like this to explicitly set the SS pin
/// NRF24 nrf24(8, 10);
///
/// For an Arduino Mega:
/// \code
///                 Mega         Sparkfun WRL-00691
///                 3V3 or 5V----VCC   (3.3V to 7V in)
///             pin D8-----------CE    (chip enable in)
///          SS pin D53----------CSN   (chip select in)
///         SCK pin D52----------SCK   (SPI clock in)
///        MOSI pin D51----------SDI   (SPI Data in)
///        MISO pin D50----------SDO   (SPI data out)
///                              IRQ   (Interrupt output, not connected)
///                 GND----------GND   (ground in)
/// \endcode
/// and you can then use the default constructor NRF24(). 
/// You can override the default settings for the CSN and CE pins 
/// in the NRF24() constructor if you wish to connect the slave select CSN to other than the normal one for your 
/// Arduino (D10 for Diecimila, Uno etc and D53 for Mega)
///
/// Caution: on some Arduinos such as the Mega 2560, if you set the slave select pin to be other than the usual SS 
/// pin (D53 on  Mega 2560), you may need to set the usual SS pin to be an output to force the Arduino into SPI 
/// master mode.
///
/// Caution: this module has not been proved to work with Leonardo, at least without level 
/// shifters between the NRF24 and the Leonardo. Tests seem to indicate that such level shifters would be required
/// with Leonardo to make it work.
///
/// It is possible to have 2 radios conected to one arduino, provided each radio has its own 
/// CSN and CE line (SCK, SDI and SDO are common to both radios)
///
/// \par Example programs
///
/// The following example programs are provided:
/// -nrf24_ping_client, nrf24_pin_server. This is a matched pair. The client sends (acknowledged)
///  4 byte timestamp to the server which replies (acknowledged). 
///  The client measures the round-trip time and prints it. Typical RTT is 1-2 msec. 
///  These are compatible radio wise with the ping_client and ping_server programs that come with the Mirf library
///   though the electrical connections are different
/// -nrf24_specan. Example sketch showing how to create a primitive spectrum analyser
///  with the NRF24 class. The nRF24L01 received power detector is only one bit, but
///  this will show which channels have more than -64dBm present.
/// -nrf24_audio_tx, nrf24_audio_rx. This is a matched pair. The clinet sends a stream of audio samples measured
///  from analog input 0 to the receiver, which reconstructs them on output D6. See comments in those files for 
///  electrical requirements. The pair demonstrates the use of NRF24 in NOACK modefor improved performance 
///  (but no reliability). Can achieve 6.4kHz sample rate. Dont expect good quality audio!
///
/// \par Radio Performance
///
/// The performance of this radio seems to be very good. I was able to build ping client/server
/// that was able to achieve over 800 round trips per second 
/// (at 0dBm power, 2Mbps, channel 1, 4 byte payload each way, 1 checksum byte) when the radios were next to each other. 
/// This rate could still be achieved at 15m distance, but the orientation of the radios and 
/// obstructions became critical. The human body can easily block these signals. 
/// Best response was when the chip antennas were broadside to each other.
/// 
/// It is possible to get even better streaming performance using NOACK mode (see the nrf24_audio_tx sample)
/// at the cost of nop reliability.
/// In NOACK mode, at 2Mbps, 32 byte payload, can get about 1900 packets per second: 60800 bytes of payload per second
///
/// Frequency accuracy may be debatable. For nominal frequency of 2401.000 MHz (ie channel 1), 
/// my Yaesu VR-5000 receiver indicated the center frequency for my test radios
/// was 2401.121 MHz. Its not clear to me if the Yaesu
/// is the source of the error, but I tend to believe it, which would make the nRF24l01 frequency out by 121kHz.
/// 
/// \par Radio operating strategy and defaults
///
/// The radio is enabled all the time, and switched between TX and RX modes depending on 
/// whether there is any data to send. Sending data sets the radio to TX mode.
/// After data is sent, the radion automatically returns to Standby II mode. Calling waitAvailable() or
/// waitAvailableTimeout() starts the radio in RX mode.
///
/// The radio is configured by default to Channel 2, 2Mbps, 0dBm power, 5 bytes address, payload width 1, CRC enabled
/// 1 byte CRC, Auto-Ack mode. Enhanced shockburst is used. 
/// P1 is the receive pipe. P0 is set to the transmit address to enable autoack.
///
/// \par Memory
///
/// Memory usage of this program is minimal. The compiled ping client and server programs are about 4000 bytes. 
/// RAM requirements of the library are minimal.
///
/// \par Installation
///
/// Install in the usual way: unzip the distribution zip file to the libraries
/// sub-folder of your sketchbook.

/// \par Revision History
///
/// \version 1.0 Initial release
///
/// \version 1.1 Changed default value for slave slect pin in constructor to be SS, ie the normal one for 
/// the compiled Arduino (D10 for Diecimila, Uno etc and D53 for Mega). This is because some Arduinos such as Mega 2560
/// reportedly use the type of the SS pin to determine whether to run in slave or master mode. Therfore it
/// is preferred that the slave select pin actually be the normal SS pin.
///
/// \version 1.2 Updated documentation about what happens during init, and that SPI is initialised to 8MHz 
/// (but can be set to other frequencies after calling init()
/// \version 1.3 Fixed error in title of main page
/// \version 1.4 Fixed typo in nrf24_test.pde, reported by TOM.
/// \version 1.6 Fixed an error NRF24::setRF in setting data rate to 250kbps. Reported by Shiu Kumar.
/// \version 1.7 Improvements to waitPacketSent() so if the chip is not in transmit mode, it wont wait forever.
///              Improvements to isSending() so it returns false if the chip is not in transmit mode.
/// \version 1.8 Fixed a conflict between 2 definitions of NRF24_TX_FULL. The one in 07 STATUS is changed to 
///              NRF24_STATUS_TX_FULL. Reported by Charles-Henri Hallard.
///              Updated author and distribution location details to airspayce.com
/// \version 1.9 Improvements to waitAvailableTimeout to make it robust on millis() rollover. 
/// \version 1.10 Testing with Leonardo and update documentation to reflect special electrical
///              connection needs on Leonardo.
/// \version 1.11 NRF24_COMMAND_W_ACK_PAYLOAD(c) is now a macro that takes a pipe number parameter.
///              Added new function setRetry(), a convenience for setting ARD and ARC retry parameter.
///              Can now customise the radio configuration byte with setConfiguration().
///              Added new examples crazyflie and crazyflie_client that use the NRF24 library to
///              communicate with Crazyflie quadcopters and transmitters.
